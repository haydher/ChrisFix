# ChrisFix

This website was made as a fun project when I was just starting with web development.

This was made in Oct of 2020. The Instagram API that was used to fetch the latest Instagram posts doesn't work anymore. 

I didn't try to fix it simply because it was just a fun project and I don't plan on working on it any longer.
